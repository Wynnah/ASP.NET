                Established in 2010 in Palette Town, BC, Canada, SilverTix has grown to provide
                its service to all provinces.&nbsp; Little is known about the founders of SilverTix.
                However, what is known is that there were 5 founders of SilverTix. The blobfish
                (Psychrolutes marcidus) is a deep sea fish of the family Psychrolutidae. Inhabiting
                the deep waters off the coasts of mainland Australia and Tasmania Blobfish live
                at depths where the pressure is several dozens of times higher than at sea level,
                which would likely make gas bladders inefficient for maintaining buoyancy. Instead,
                the flesh of the blobfish is primarily a gelatinous mass with a density slightly
                less than water; this allows the fish to float above the sea floor without expending
                energy on swimming. Its relative lack of muscle is not a disadvantage as it primarily
                swallows edible matter that floats by in front of it.Blobfish can be caught by bottom
                trawling with nets. Such trawling in the waters off Australia may threaten the blobfish
                in what may be its only habitat.(Wikipedia, 2010)
